# Conways Game of Life

This project aims to implement Conway's Game of Life. There is no particular reason for implementing this, it was just a fun idea I had to use as an excuse to learn the Rust language. 

> Nothing here is safe or efficient. This is a case study.

> > The initial idea was to implement game of life in different surfaces than 2d plane, hopefully ill implement it some day
